# Bitcoin Graph study with NetworkX

This is my University work, made to study a realistic Graph. The one I've chosen is the Bitcoin Alpha Graph.

## Getting Started

To download my repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/riki95/Bitcoin-Graph-study-with-NetworkX
```

The program was written in Python and compiled with Python 3.6 so you need it to run it.
The program needs a graph in input which is a csv file and I used the Bitcoin Alpha Dataset.

### Bitcoin Alpha Dataset

The [Bitcoin Alpha Dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoin-alpha.html) is a csv file that consists on 4 columns:
```
SOURCE, TARGET, RATING, TIME
```

I've decided to only study Source, Target and Rating because Time was not so important to care about.
You can just download my repo and you will find the dataset with the first row removed (it was the one with the Column's names) or you can download it from the official website.
